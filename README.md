# Oracle JET (v2.2.0) seed project

> Oracle JET is targeted at intermediate to advanced JavaScript developers working on client-side applications. It's a collection of open source JavaScript libraries along with a set of Oracle contributed JavaScript libraries that make it as simple and efficient as possible to build applications that consume and interact with Oracle products and services, especially Oracle Cloud services.

This is a seed project with the minimum configuration needed to have Oracle JET working within a project.

It only has the Oracle JET library and all of its dependencies set up correctly to start working with it.

This is intended to be used as a "sandbox" to play with and learn the tool at its core functionality, for more ambitious projects please use the steps provided in the [official website](http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/jet/globalGetStarted.html)
